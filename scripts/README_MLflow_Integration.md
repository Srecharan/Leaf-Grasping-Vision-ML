## Configuration Generation

### MLflowExperimentManager

The `MLflowExperimentManager` class generates comprehensive experimental configurations:

```python
# Generate 60+ systematic configurations
configs = manager.generate_comprehensive_configs()

# Includes:
# - 4 attention mechanisms (spatial, channel, hybrid, none)
# - 4 architecture variants (lightweight, standard, deep, wide)
# - 4 learning rates (0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002)
# - 3 batch sizes (8, 16, 32)
# - 4 confidence weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)
# - 3 weight decay values (0.01, 0.001, 0.0001)
# - 4 positive weights for class imbalance (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0)
```

### Experiment Groups

1. **Attention-Architecture Sweep**: Systematic testing of all attention mechanisms across different architectures
2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Fine-tuning of learning parameters for best-performing configurations

## Model Architecture Variations

### 1. **Lightweight Architecture**
- **Filters**: [32, 64, 128]
- **Parameters**: ~50K
- **Use Case**: Edge deployment, real-time inference
- **Target**: Fast processing with acceptable accuracy

### 2. **Standard Architecture** 
- **Filters**: [64, 128, 256]
- **Parameters**: ~200K
- **Use Case**: Production deployment
- **Target**: Balanced performance and efficiency

### 3. **Deep Architecture**
- **Filters**: [64, 128, 256, 512]
- **Parameters**: ~500K
- **Use Case**: High-accuracy scenarios
- **Target**: Complex feature learning

### 4. **Wide Architecture**
- **Filters**: [128, 256, 512]
- **Parameters**: ~800K
- **Use Case**: Research scenarios
- **Target**: Maximum representation capacity

## Attention Mechanisms

### 1. **Spatial Attention**
```python
attention = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(filters, 1, kernel_size=1),
    nn.Sigmoid()
)
```
- Focuses on spatial locations within feature maps
- Best for grasp point localization

### 2. **Channel Attention**
```python
attention = nn.Sequential(
    nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1),
    nn.Conv2d(filters, filters // 16, kernel_size=1),
    nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
    nn.Conv2d(filters // 16, filters, kernel_size=1),
    nn.Sigmoid()
)
```
- Emphasizes important feature channels
- Best for feature discrimination

### 3. **Hybrid Attention**
- Combines both spatial and channel attention
- Applies multiplicative combination for maximum benefit

### 4. **No Attention (Baseline)**
- Standard CNN without attention mechanisms
- Computational efficiency baseline

## Confidence Weighting Strategies

The hybrid CV-ML approach uses dynamic confidence weighting:

| ML Weight | CV Weight | Strategy | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| 10% | 90% | Conservative | Rely on proven geometric algorithms |
| 20% | 80% | Balanced | Moderate ML influence with safety |
| 30% | 70% | Progressive | Increased ML confidence with backup |
| 40% | 60% | Aggressive | High ML confidence for edge cases |
